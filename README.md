Welcome to the Saturnizer Project! The goal of this project is to "Saturnize" modern games by modding in SEGA Saturn button icons into them.

For now the main focus is on digital-only gamepads such as the original Saturn controller and 8BitDo M30,
but I'll gladly add some priority to analog games once I have suitable controllers like the Retro-Bit Saturn Pro or Retro Fighters BrawlerGen USB.

GitHub only allows 100MB files so some of these might have to be split.
